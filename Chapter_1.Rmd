## Data Visualization with ggplot2

We will in this chapter focus on the dataset __mpg__, which contains data 38 models of cars. 
We start out by plotting the relationship between a car's engine size (_displ_) and a car's fuel efficiency (_hwy_).
```{r,include = T}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
## Exercises

### 3 
The _drv_ variable describe if the car had four wheel drive, front weel drive or rear wheel drive

### 4 - Make a scatterplot of _hwy_ vs. _cyl_

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(x = cyl, y = hwy) 
```
This will not be usefull due to the fact that _cyl_ is a catagorical variable.
